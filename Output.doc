Young"s Modulus,E                             = 2.00 × 10^5 N/mm^3
Effective Length,L_lt                         = 5000.00 mm
Torsional Constant,I_t                        = 0.05 × 10^6 mm^4
Warping Constant,I_w                          = 0.01 × 10^12 mm^6
Lateral Torsional Buckling Moment,M_cr        = 21.30 kNm
Non-Dimensional Slenderness Ratio,lembda_lt   = 1.33 <= 1.36 
Imperfection Parameter,Alpha_lt               = 0.21, section is rolled
Phi_lt                                        = 1.50 
Bending Stress Reduction Factor,Xi_lt         = 0.45
Design Bending Compressive Stress,f_bd        = 103.36 N/mm^2
Design Bending Capacity,M_d                   = 15.54 kNm

So,Design Bending Capacity is greater than applied Factored Moment
which is all right!

Check for deflection

deflection of the beam is           4.35 mm
allowable deflection of the beam is 33.33 mm
